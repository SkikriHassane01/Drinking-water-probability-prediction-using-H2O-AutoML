# Drinking water probability prediction using H2O AutoML

## overview

In this project, we focus on developing a machine learning model to predict the potability (drinkability) of water using a dataset that includes various chemical features of water samples. Ensuring the safety of drinking water is crucial for public health, and predictive models can help assess water quality quickly and accurately.

# what is h2o AutoML

H2O AutoML is an automated machine learning tool provided by the H2O.ai platform. It simplifies the process of applying machine learning by automatically training and tuning models. H2O AutoML handles:
- `Model Selection:` It explores a variety of algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Deep Learning, and others.
- `Hyperparameter Tuning:` Automatically tunes hyperparameters to find the best configuration for each algorithm.
- `Ensembling:` Combines the strengths of different models through stacking to improve prediction accuracy.
- `Model Ranking:` Ranks models based on performance metrics and selects the best one.
